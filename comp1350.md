# Entities
Objects or real world concepts that are represented and stored in a database. Attributes define an entity's properties.

## Strong Entity
Exists independently of other entities. It has its own unique identifier (primary identifier), which distinguishes each copy of the entity from each other. 

## Weak Entity
Depends on a strong (parent) entity. Does not own its own primary identifier.

## Associative Entity
AKA relationship entities, are used to represent many-to-many relationships between two or more entities. They contain attributes that describe the relationship itself.
