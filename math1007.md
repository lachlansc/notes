# Simple graph
A graph that does not contain any loops or double edges

# K5 graph
A graph with 5 verticies and 10 edges (creates a pentagon)

# Planar
Drawing of a graph is planar if no edges cross each other

Every planar drawing breaks the page into a number of faces (partition)

# Face
A face can have interior and exterior faces.\n
The degree of a face is the number of edges going around the outside

# Handshake therom
Sum degrees of faces = 2 * edges

# Eulers formula
In any planar drawing, we have:
|V| - |E| + |F| = 2
