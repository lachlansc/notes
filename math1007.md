# --- GRAPHS ---

# Simple graph
A graph that does not contain any loops or double edges

# Bipartite graph
A graph where the verticies can be categorised into two groups, with no adjacent verticies coexisting within the same group.

# K5 graph
A graph with 5 verticies and 10 edges (creates a pentagon)

# Planar
Drawing of a graph is planar if no edges cross each other

Every planar drawing breaks the page into a number of faces (partition)

# Eulerian
Follows every edge once

# Degree of verticies
- Sum of degrees must be even
- With two verticies of odd degree, graph is eulerian path
- With all verticies even, graph is eulerian cycle
- With more than two odd degrees verticies, graph is neither eulerian path or cycle

# Face
A face can have interior and exterior faces.\n
The degree of a face is the number of edges going around the outside

# Handshake therom
Sum degrees of faces = 2 * edges
Edges = sum of degrees / 2

# Eulers formula
In any planar drawing, we have:
|V| - |E| + |F| = 2

# Tree
A tree has one more vertex than it does edges

# Spanning tree
A subgraph that includes all verticies of original graph, and is a tree\n
Fringe = next possible edge for spanning tree


# --- LOGIC ---
**AND** is the conjunction of propositions. Notation = p ^ q (or p q)\n
**OR** is disconjunction of propositions. Notation = p âŒ„ q (or p + q)
